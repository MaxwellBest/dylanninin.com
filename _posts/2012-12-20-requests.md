Requests is an [Apache2 Licensed](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/intro/#apache2) HTTP library, written in Python, for human beings.

Python's standard urllib2 module provides most of the HTTP capabilities you need, but the API is thoroughly broken. It was built for a different time -- and a different web. It requires an enormous amount of work (even method overrides) to perform the simplest of tasks.

Things shouldn't be this way. Not in Python.

	>>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/user', auth=('user', 'pass'))
	>>> r.status_code
	200
	>>> r.headers['content-type']
	'application/json; charset=utf8'
	>>> r.encoding
	'utf-8'
	>>> r.text
	u'{"type":"User"...'
	>>> r.json
	{u'private_gists': 419, u'total_private_repos': 77, ...}

similar code in urllib2.

	#!/usr/bin/env python
	# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
	import urllib2
	gh_url = 'https://api.github.com'
	req = urllib2.Request(gh_url)
	 
	password_manager = urllib2.HTTPPasswordMgrWithDefaultRealm()
	password_manager.add_password(None, gh_url, 'user', 'pass')
	 
	auth_manager = urllib2.HTTPBasicAuthHandler(password_manager)
	opener = urllib2.build_opener(auth_manager)
	urllib2.install_opener(opener)
	handler = urllib2.urlopen(req)
	 
	print handler.getcode()
	print handler.headers.getheader('content-type')
	# ------
	# 200
	# 'application/json'

Requests takes all of the work out of Python HTTP/1.1 -- making your integration with web services seamless. There's no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling are 100% automatic, powered by [urllib3](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3), which is embedded within Requests.
