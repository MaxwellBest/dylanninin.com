学习Python的第一个Web框架就是[web.py](http://webpy.org/)，没想到它的作者Aaron Swartz已经于2013年1月11日自杀。

2012年年末计划用Python将此博客重写，其中Web框架经过一翻[选型](http://wiki.woodpecker.org.cn/moin/PyWebFrameList)，便确定使用[web.py](http://webpy.org/)。本打算利用周末时间，希望能在年前完成，但因迫近年关诸事繁忙，现在才刚刚搭建起基本的项目框架。真是诸行无常，现在唯一能纪念的，就是作为一个程序员，学习吸收Aaron Swartz的思想，尽快的完成这个项目，并发布到[github](http://github.com/)，也算是对web.py的一种推介，对Aaron Swartz的一种追思。

Aaron Swartz commits suicide By Anne Cai -- NEWS EDITOR; UPDATED AT 2:15 A.M. 1/12/13

Computer activist Aaron H. Swartz committed suicide in New York City yesterday, Jan. 11, according to his uncle, Michael Wolf, in a comment to The Tech. Swartz was 26.

"The tragic and heartbreaking information you received is, regrettably, true," confirmed Swartz' attorney, Elliot R. Peters of Kecker and Van Nest, in an email to The Tech.

Swartz was indicted in July 2011 by a federal grand jury for allegedly mass downloading documents from the JSTOR online journal archive with the intent to distribute them. He subsequently moved to Brooklyn, New York, where he then worked for Avaaz Foundation, a nonprofit "global web movement to bring people-powered politics to decision-making everywhere." Swartz appeared in court on Sept. 24, 2012 and pleaded not guilty.

The accomplished Swartz co-authored the now widely-used RSS 1.0 specification at age 14, was one of the three co-owners of the popular social news site Reddit, and completed a fellowship at Harvard's Ethics Center Lab on Institutional Corruption. In 2010, he founded [DemandProgress.org](http://demandprogress.org/), a "campaign against the Internet censorship bills SOPA/PIPA."
