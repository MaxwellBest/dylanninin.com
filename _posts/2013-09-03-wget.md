title: Use Wget to Detect Dead Links
category : Linux
tags : [Linux, Utilities]

Typical wget usage:

	wget -r --spider -b -o /var/tmp/wget.log http://target.site.com/

	-r - Recursive download
	--spider - Check downloaded content for new links, then discard
	-b - Run in the background
	-o /var/tmp/wget.log - Target log file

	http://target.site.com/ - Replace with the site you want to check

wget will create a log file detailing the status codes reported while downloading content from the target site - note that this method will catch links to nonexistent content from within the domain, however, off-site links will not be checked (which is why it pays to monitor your site's error logs).
